I'm researching the application of Dual Energy CT (DECT) in evaluating treatment responses in multiple myeloma, focusing on its capability to discern non-osteolytic lesions and assess bone marrow activity, compared to the standard MRI and clinical parameters. This aims to enhance diagnostic accuracy in myeloma-related bone involvements.
