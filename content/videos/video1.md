"Fragments d'Une Présence" is an abstract visual and sonic Hip-Hop journey through the Afro-Francophone world. At its core, this project explores the raw power and radical honesty of hardcore Francophone Hip-Hop — not just as music, but as resistance. Through layered imagery, sound, and silence, the piece dives into themes of postcolonial identity, cultural survival, systemic erasure, and the ongoing legacy of neocolonialism across Africa and its diaspora.

This work does not offer neat conclusions. Instead, it presents fragments — of memory, history, rage, pride, and presence — inviting viewers to feel, reflect, and engage with the complex intersections of language, power, and place. From Dakar to Paris, St. Louis to Pantin, Fragments d'Une Présence pays tribute to voices too often overlooked, yet impossible to ignore.

This is not a documentary. It's not a music video. It's a presence — fractured, felt, and unapologetically alive.
