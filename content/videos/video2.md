This video, created as part of my CS338: Computer Security Final Project at Carleton College (Fall 2024), dives into the fascinating story of Alan Turing and his pivotal role in breaking the German Enigma code during World War II.

Through detailed analysis and historical context, we explore how Turing's brilliance, alongside a remarkable team of cryptanalysts, led to critical breakthroughs that changed the war's trajectory. This journey blends historical photos, educational references, and compelling visuals, including contributions from Marian Rejewski, Jerzy Różycki, Henryk Zygalski, and others who shaped this monumental effort.
