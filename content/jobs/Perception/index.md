- Conducted experiments on the human brain’s speech perception, accuracy, and identifiability in challenging listening conditions, particularly in background noise, using R for data analysis.
- Quantified speech perception accuracy by developing a statistical model that measured recognition rates of spoken words in varying noise environments, revealing that recognition accuracy dropped by 20% as background noise intensity
  doubled.
- Contributed to the enhancement of cognitive models by validating a new auditory processing theory, improving the predictive accuracy of speech perception models by 15%.
