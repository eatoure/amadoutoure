- Participated in Pre-Med Insight, a mentorship and internship program at the Mayo Clinic Alix School of Medicine designed for pre-medical students of minority and disadvantaged backgrounds.
- The program aims to provide early exposure, simulation-based learning, and career resources in medicine to enthusiastic pre-medical students.
- Completed a year-long internship, during which I was paired with a medical student mentor and collaborated with an interdisciplinary team consisting of peers, physicians, staff, medical students, and patients.
- Engaged in clinical and surgical simulations, small group projects and discussions, skill-building activities, and interdisciplinary interactions among peers, physicians, patients, faculty, staff, and other professionals in the field.
- Involved in mentor-mentee interactions, community service projects, and pursued opportunities to explore and challenge limits in the medical field.
