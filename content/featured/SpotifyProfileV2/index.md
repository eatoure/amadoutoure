Currently at the Medical Practice Evaluation Center (MPEC) at BWH MassGen, I am utilizing machine learning to analyze cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors in Bangladesh. My work focuses on clustering socioeconomic and behavioral data to predict chronic disease outcomes, informing healthcare strategies in low and middle-income countries. Additionally, I'm contributing to data analysis projects on integrating non-communicable disease (NCD) screening in HIV care centers and early-phase predictions related to GLP-1s and Ozempic.
