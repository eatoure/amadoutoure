I'm actively contributing in researching the role of deep learning in clinical and epidemiological data analysis, focusing on the capabilities of neural networks in causal effect estimation and clinical risk prediction. The work is led by Dr. Leo Anthony Celi, M.D., and we are seeking to illustrate the potential of neural networks in medical AI and address the current limitations, with the goal of advancing the field and exploring untapped potentials in medical artificial intelligence.
